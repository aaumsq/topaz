An out-of-order, single issue processor for the LC3-b ISA

This code was developed for the final project for ECE 411 - Computer Organization and Design at UIUC. I wrote it with group partners Neil Singh and Saurav Puri. Some code was provided by course instructors.

The processor is based on the traditional Tomasulo out-of-order design. There is a functioning branch predictor. There is a two-level cache but it had several bugs at the end of development.
